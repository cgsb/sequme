Sequme
======

A library for NYU's bioinformatics software.

### Build

Simply call

    ./please configure [--prefix /some/prefix]
    ./please build
    ./please install

See `please help` for other options.

The installation uses `ocamlfind`, the prefix is used only for
installing the documentation (generated with `please doc`).

### Documentation

For now, you may run:

    ./please doc
    ./please doclib

and have a look at `_build/doc/index.html` and `_build/doc/lib/index.html`.
Also:

    ./please install-doc

will install the documentation in `$prefix/share/doc/sequme`.
