Sequme - NYU Bioinformatics Software

This README is *under construction*.


----------------
Below is Francis Kirigin's README for the curate_peaks.py and
RefGeneDB.py scripts.

Code Design
===========
curate_peaks.py
o Main driver script.

RefGeneDB.py
o Main logic pieces.
o Worker functions are:
  - resolve_dups()
  - lookup_chr(...)

These handle the per peak introspection along the reference genome, to
curate a given peak by genomic value and importance.  Some of this has
gone through many stages of revision (and still under debate), so if
you have any insight or ideas, please do not be shy.


Peak Processing
===============
Each peak is considered sequentially, without knowledge of other
peaks; each peak considers all genes falling within their region or
domain of interest.


Sample Input/Output files
=======================
Sample input is taken from the peak-calling software, MACS; the
associated output from the run above being:

    http://wongburger.bio.nyu.edu/~fkirigin/th17/results/ChIP-Seq/multi/RORg-ko-STAT3-98/macs/

MACS generates a number of files, I almost always process the file
ending in: *_peaks.xls,

The input file used for annotation analysis being:

    http://wongburger.bio.nyu.edu/~fkirigin/th17/results/ChIP-Seq/multi/RORg-ko-STAT3-98/macs/RORg-ko-STAT3-98-20101105-0222_peaks.xls


Example
=======
    $ curate_peaks.py RORg-ko-STAT3-98-20101105-0222_peaks.xls > RORg-ko-STAT3-98-20101105-0222_peaks.xls

This generates a number of files, which have been generated and placed
in the dir below:
