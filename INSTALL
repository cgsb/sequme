INSTALLING
==========
Quickstart:

    ocaml make.ml setup
    ocaml setup.ml -configure
    make build
    make reinstall

Additional Details:

The command `ocaml make.ml setup` is a replacement for `oasis
setup`. It does a few extra things that oasis does not support
directly. This step is only required when compiling a development
version of the code. Most end-users will be compiling released
versions, and should skip this step.

The -configure step may require additional options to be specified. In
particular, the --prefix option is often necessary. Do

    ocaml setup.ml -configure --help

for additional information.

The Makefile is generated by oasis. The `make foo` commands are
equivalent to `ocaml setup.ml -foo`.


UNINSTALL
=========
Do:

    make uninstall


CLEAN
=====
To completely delete all compiled and installed files, it is necessary
to do:

    make distclean
    ocaml make.ml setup-clean

The last of these commands is a replacement for `oasis setup-clean`,
which does not appear to do anything. This command should not be run
in released versions of the code, or you will need to run `ocaml
make.ml setup` to regenerate some files.
